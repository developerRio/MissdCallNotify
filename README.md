# MissedCallNotify
I took the idea from this app Truecaller, it shows a dialog after every call(outgoing/missed), it basically notify the user about. 
So I developed this entire feature on my own. Just used broadcast receiver & for saving the phone number I used Firebase Firestore, 
which becomes handy specially when you have to store real-time data.
